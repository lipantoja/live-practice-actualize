# Spend the next 5-10 minutes decomposing the following problem
# (just decompose the problem, do not write any code to actually solve the problem for now):
# Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling. 

# It should have two methods: 
# roll which takes in the number of pins knocked down, and (Roll Method)
  # Have user at a base score of 0
  # Player rolls ball and hits x amount of pins out of 10
  # total player score based off of amount of pins hit
  # Assuming the same player on next turn, start score at total of previous score
  # Assume the same steps of x amount of pins hit, sum of pins hit, and add to score on a seperate line (maybe?)
  # -------
  # get user input
  # assign 
  # create a method that takes in the variable and subtracts from 10 pins
  # find the sum of the total pins remaining
  # -------
# score which is called at the end and (Score Method)
  
# returns the total game score.
  # end score should be the sum of all 10 round, sum of all pins knocked down  
  # display final score to screen
